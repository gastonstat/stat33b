# STAT 33B - Introduction to Advanced Programming in R

- __Description__: The course is designed primarily for those who are already familiar with programming in another language (e.g. Python, C, Java), and want to understand how R works, and for those who already know the basics of R programming and want to gain a more in-depth understanding of the language in order to improve their coding. The focus is on the underlying paradigms in R, such as atomic and non-atomic vectors, functional programming, environments, and object systems (time permitting). The goal of this course is to better understand programming principles in R and to write better R code that capitalizes on the language's design. Topics include (not necessarily covered in the following order): 

    + Data types and data structures in R (e.g. vectors, arrays, lists, data frames)
    + :hammer: Tools for data manipulation
    + :bar_chart: Tools for data visualization
    + :inbox_tray: Data input/output
    + :twisted_rightwards_arrows: Control flow structures (e.g. conditionals, iterations)
    + :pencil: Writing simple functions
    + :loudspeaker: Function calls
    + :bookmark_tabs: Argument matching
    + :heavy_plus_sign: The formula language of R (time permitting)
    + :gift: Building simple R packages
